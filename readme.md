Hi, I’m Louan Bardou

My mission is to contribute to the survival and expansion of human consciousness. Everything I study like AI, autonomy, and material science, is part of that journey. I want to build systems that can learn, adapt, and survive in extreme environments.

I’m currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at École Polytechnique (MX25), after completing a degree in Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

Current Research Interests :

- Self-Supervised Learning
- Multimodal Perception
- Causal Reasoning
- Materials in Extreme Conditions (cryogenic temperatures, radiation)
- Space Systems and Communication

I’m fascinated by autonomy, both human and artificial.

My goal is to contribute to technologies that make exploration sustainable and meaningful, wherever we will go next.
